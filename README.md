TBD


    1. Next.js Application Setup:
        Prepare your Next.js application for SSR. Ensure you do not use next export as it disables SSR features.
        Implement any server-side logic or API calls as required by your application.

    2. Deployment to AWS Lambda:
        Package your Next.js app for Lambda deployment.
        Ensure that your Lambda function can handle web requests and responses. Libraries like serverless-http can help.

            Step 3: Deploy with AWS

                Configure AWS Credentials:
                Use the AWS CLI to configure your credentials, or set environment variables.

                Deploy Your Application:
                From the root directory, run:

                bash

                serverless deploy

            Step 4: Integrate with Amazon CloudFront

                Set up a CloudFront Distribution:
                Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to create a CloudFront distribution. Set the origin to the AWS Lambda function URL provided by the Serverless deployment.

            Step 5: Set Up DNS with Cloudflare

                DNS Configuration:
                In Cloudflare, update DNS settings to point your domain to the CloudFront distribution using CNAME records.

            Step 6: Testing and Validation

            After deploying, test your application to ensure it renders correctly. Use the AWS Management Console to check CloudWatch logs for any errors.

    3. Integrate with Amazon CloudFront:
        Set up a new CloudFront distribution.
        Configure CloudFront to use your Lambda function as the origin. This setup involves creating a Lambda@Edge association, which triggers your function on viewer requests.
        Define caching policies based on your application's needs. For dynamic content, you might reduce cache lifetimes or use settings that vary the cache based on cookies or headers.

    4. Set Up Cloudflare:
        Point your domain’s DNS settings to Cloudflare.
        Configure Cloudflare to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution. Ensure SSL/TLS settings are correctly configured to handle the HTTPS requests.
        Utilize Cloudflare’s Page Rules for fine-grained control over caching and security rules.

    5. Testing and Validation:
        After deploying, thoroughly test your application to ensure that pages render correctly and dynamically.
        Monitor Lambda and CloudFront logs for any errors or performance issues.
